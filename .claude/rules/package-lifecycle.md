# Package host lifecycle: `init` / `destroy`

Every package **host** custom element (`extends HTMLElement`) must expose a public bind/unbind API so apps can destroy and rebuild behaviour from outside (e.g. after mutating light DOM).

## Required shape

```ts
class Host extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback(): void {
    this.init();
  }

  disconnectedCallback(): void {
    this.destroy();
  }

  /** Bind markup + listeners. Does not call `destroy()`. */
  init(): void {
    // …
  }

  /** Unbind. Safe to call externally while the node stays in the document. */
  destroy(): void {
    // remove listeners, observers, child controllers…
  }
}
```

## Rules

- `connectedCallback` → `init()`; `disconnectedCallback` → `destroy()`.
- `init()` must **not** call `destroy()`. Binding and unbinding stay separate.
- The app (or docs demo) is responsible for calling `destroy()` before a re-`init()` when already bound.
- `destroy()` / `init()` stay **public** — not only for connect/disconnect.
- Prefer storing listener references (or bound methods) so `destroy()` can remove them; avoid anonymous `addEventListener` callbacks that cannot be detached.
- Child controllers (Panel, Tab, …) follow the same `init` / `destroy` pair when they own listeners.
- Document the runtime pattern in the package README when DOM mutation is expected:

```js
el.destroy();
// mutate light DOM…
el.init();
```

## Do not

- Call `destroy()` from inside `init()`.
- Rely only on `disconnectedCallback` for teardown when the host stays mounted.
- Hide `destroy` as private / `#destroy` — consumers need it.
