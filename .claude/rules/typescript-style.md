# TypeScript style

## DOM references

Prefix **variables and parameters** that hold a DOM element with `$` (same as
cached host properties: `$thumb`, `$input`, `$panel`).

```ts
const $thumb = event.currentTarget as HTMLElement;
protected bindThumb($thumb: HTMLElement): void { ... }
```

`thumbSize`, `trackLength`, and other non-element values stay unprefixed.

## Destructuring

Prefer **destructuring** when several fields from the same object are used:

- Events: `const { key, clientX, clientY, pointerId } = event`
- DOM rects: `const { top, left, width, height } = el.getBoundingClientRect()`
- Options: `const { emit = true, active = this.#active } = options`
- State: `const { id, $thumb } = this.#drag` before use

Match existing package patterns (e.g. spinbutton `#handleChange = ({ target }: Event)`).

Do not destructure when it hides intent (single `event.key` in an early guard, or a one-off property read).

## Branching

Prefer **separate `if` blocks** over `if/else` when each branch stands on its
own. Avoid multi-line ternaries for the same cases.

When one branch is the common case, assign it as the **default value**, then
guard only the exception:

```ts
let offset = left + width / 2 - clientX;

if (this.isVertical) {
  offset = top + height / 2 - clientY;
}
```

Use `if/else` only when the branches are tightly coupled or the negative case
would read awkwardly as a second guard.
